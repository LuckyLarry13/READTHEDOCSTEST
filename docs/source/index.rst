.. note::

   This project is under active development.

Our Scope
--------
We wanted to create a simple language learning app, that would be user friendly and easy to use.

Our user requirements
---------------------
Gamification
Users want several learning modes to be able to choose the way in which they learn.

Users also desired other gamification elements, such as leaderboards, and a “score” system that were also popular with participants, in particular the ability to compare progress to friends and peers was seen as an upside.

Users expressed a desire for more engagement and motivation from the application, as they felt they weren’t being encouraged to keep using the app enough. Notifications were seen as a positive feature, so long as they were not overwhelming.

Spelling and Grammar
Users wanted a way to understand the spelling, punctuation and grammar of their chosen language. 
Users frequently expressed how they had issues with spelling and grammar, as they felt other applications would tell them when their spelling/grammar was wrong, but not why.

Users expressed a desire for features that would have simple infographics to teach them spelling and grammar rules, including things like verb endings, conjugations, pronouns, etc.

Target Audience
Users want to have their difficulty adjusted to them, as we had a wide variety of participants across skill levels, with the majority being beginner users.
Users should be treated equally, making sure the leaderboard/score systems are the same for all.

Progress Tracking and Feedback
Users want a way to track progress, as many felt they were unsure of how effectively they were studying, and whether or not they were progressing at a solid pace.

Usability and Accessibility
Users want an easily usable and accessible app, designed with the user in mind, where you can easily find your way around and get to any part of the app in as few button presses as possible.
Social Features and Community Building
Users wanted a wide some social features e.g. leaderboards 
Language
Users want several ways to learn their chosen language, ranging from quizzes to flashcards and. conversation practice.
Users want a variety of speeds to learn at, both quick-fire shorter questions and longer conversations.
Users wanted to have their difficulty adjust to how well they’re doing, if participants are stuck the questions should get easier, and vice versa.

--NOTE NOT SOME OF THESE REQUIREMENTS HAVE CHANGED SINCE THE FIRST SUBMISSION DUE TO SCOPE, TIME AND RESOURCES.
